; DISCLAIMER:
;
; The functions found within this file cannot be used as effect commands.
; An effect command can only reference a function found within effect_functions.asm.
; However, it is possible for a function from effect_functions.asm
;	to "farcall" a function from effect_functions2.asm.
; Since effect_functions.asm and effect_functions2.asm are stored in separate memory banks,
;	neither "call" nor "jp" can be used to move from one to the other.
;	"Farcall" is the only option available for switching between functions in the two files.
;
; Most importantly, there is now a lot of free space in the main effect functions bank,
; 	so I would only recommend using this file to store larger, mostly self-contained functions,
;	like the search functions that have already been relocated.
; Depending on your knowledge of assembly programming and the scope of your project,
;	you might not need to use this file at all.
